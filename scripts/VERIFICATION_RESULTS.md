✗ VERIFICATION FAILED

## Findings Analysis

### 1. Missing Implementation Files (3 issues)

Three header files declare classes with methods but are missing their `.cpp` implementation files:

- `src/ai/federated_learning.h` - FederatedLearningManager class
- `src/ai/multithreaded_inference.h` - MultithreadedInferenceEngine class
- `src/environmental/environmental_integration.h` - Environmental integration

**Impact:** These files need implementations or should be refactored as header-only.

### 2. Undefined Extern Variables (6 issues)

Six extern declarations found without matching definitions:

- `g_connectivityOrchestrator` - Global connectivity orchestrator instance
- `g_fl_manager` - Federated learning manager instance
- `FL_CONFIG_CONSERVATIVE` - Configuration constant
- `FL_CONFIG_BALANCED` - Configuration constant
- `FL_CONFIG_AGGRESSIVE` - Configuration constant
- `g_multithreaded_engine` - Multithreaded inference engine

**Impact:** These need to be defined in `.cpp` files to avoid linker errors.

### 3. Undocumented TODOs (78 issues)

78 TODO comments found in the source code that are not tracked in `TODO.md`:

Common patterns:
- Power management features
- Network implementation stubs
- OTA update logic
- Data upload functionality
- Health check implementations

**Impact:** These should be documented in `TODO.md` or converted to GitHub issues for tracking.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Create missing implementation files** or refactor headers as header-only
2. **Define extern variables** in appropriate `.cpp` files
3. **Create `TODO.md`** to document all pending work items

### Development Process

1. Run `verify_build.py --skip-build` before each commit
2. Address issues incrementally
3. Use the script in CI pipeline to prevent regressions

### Long-term Improvements

1. Set up pre-commit hooks with verification
2. Create GitHub issues for all TODOs
3. Gradually resolve undefined externs
4. Complete missing implementations

## Script Benefits

✅ **Early Detection** - Catches issues before they reach production  
✅ **Code Quality** - Enforces consistency across the codebase  
✅ **Documentation** - Ensures TODOs are tracked properly  
✅ **Build Validation** - Verifies firmware fits in flash memory  
✅ **Multi-Board Support** - Tests across different hardware variants  

## Next Steps

1. Review findings with development team
2. Prioritize issues for resolution
3. Integrate script into CI/CD pipeline
4. Set up regular verification runs
5. Document resolution plan in project tracker

## Continuous Improvement

The script can be enhanced with:
- Custom rules for project-specific patterns
- Integration with issue tracking systems
- Automated PR comments with findings
- Trend analysis over time
- Performance metrics tracking
