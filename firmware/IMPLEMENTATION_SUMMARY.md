- PlatformIO test framework execution
- Test artifact upload for review
- Proper dependency caching for faster builds
- Parallel execution with other CI jobs

### 3. Documentation

#### Comprehensive Documentation (3 files)
1. **TEST_README.md** (10KB)
   - Complete testing guide
   - Test categories and organization
   - Running tests locally
   - Writing new tests
   - Best practices
   - Troubleshooting

2. **TESTING_QUICK_REFERENCE.md** (4KB)
   - Quick start commands
   - Test statistics
   - Common patterns
   - Assertion reference
   - CI/CD integration info

3. **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** (this file)
   - Overview of implementation

### 4. Automation Scripts

#### Helper Scripts (2)
1. **scripts/run_tests.sh** (executable)
   - Runs all tests with proper formatting
   - Checks for PlatformIO installation
   - Provides clear pass/fail output

2. **scripts/test_summary.sh** (executable)
   - Generates test statistics
   - Lists all test files
   - Shows coverage by category
