## 🔧 Step 1: Assemble Hardware (15 minutes)

### 1.1 Insert the SD Card

1. **Format your SD card**:
   - Insert SD card into your computer
   - Format as **FAT32** (not exFAT or NTFS)
   - On Windows: Right-click drive → Format → FAT32
   - On Mac: Disk Utility → Erase → MS-DOS (FAT)

2. **Insert into ESP32-CAM**:
   - Locate the SD card slot on the back of the ESP32-CAM
   - Insert the SD card with contacts facing the board
   - Push until it clicks into place

### 1.2 Connect PIR Motion Sensor

**PIR Sensor Pinout** (3 pins):
- **VCC** (or +) = Power (5V)
- **GND** (or -) = Ground
- **OUT** (or Signal) = Signal to ESP32

**Wiring Instructions**:

```
PIR Sensor → ESP32-CAM
VCC        → 5V pin
GND        → GND pin
OUT        → GPIO 13
```

**Visual Diagram**:
```
     PIR Sensor
    ┌──────────┐
    │  [Dome]  │
    │          │
    │ VCC GND  │
    │  │   │   │
    │  │   │ OUT
    └──┼───┼───┼──
       │   │   │
       ↓   ↓   ↓
     ┌──────────────┐
     │  ESP32-CAM   │
     │              │
     │ 5V  GND  13  │
     └──────────────┘
```

**Tips**:
- Use red wire for VCC (power)
- Use black wire for GND (ground)
- Use yellow/white wire for OUT (signal)

### 1.3 Connect FTDI Programmer

**Important**: This is ONLY for uploading firmware. Remove after programming!

```
FTDI Adapter → ESP32-CAM
5V          → 5V
GND         → GND
TX          → UOR (marked on board)
RX          → UOT (marked on board)
```

**CRITICAL**: Before uploading firmware, you must:
1. Connect **GPIO 0 to GND** (using a jumper wire)
2. This puts ESP32-CAM in programming mode
3. Remove this jumper after uploading!

**Programming Mode Setup**:
```
┌────────────────┐
│   ESP32-CAM    │
│                │
│  GPIO0 ─┬─ GND│  ← Connect with jumper wire
│         │      │
└─────────┴──────┘
```

### 1.4 Power Connection

**For Testing**:
- Power from FTDI adapter (5V from USB)
- **OR** use separate 5V USB power supply

**For Final Deployment**:
- Use 5V USB power bank or wall adapter
- Minimum 1A current rating recommended
- For outdoor: Solar panel + battery (see deployment tips)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Camera Won't Initialize

**Symptoms**:
```
[ERROR] Camera initialization failed
[ERROR] Camera probe failed
```

**Solutions**:
1. **Check power supply**: ESP32-CAM needs stable 5V with at least 1A
2. **Reseat camera module**: Gently disconnect and reconnect the camera ribbon cable
3. **Try different camera model**: Edit `config.h`, uncomment different `CAMERA_MODEL`
4. **Check for loose connections**: Ensure all pins are firmly connected

### No WiFi Connection

**Symptoms**:
```
[ERROR] WiFi connection failed
[ERROR] WiFi timeout
```

**Solutions**:
1. **Verify credentials**: Double-check SSID and password in `config.h` (case-sensitive!)
2. **Check WiFi band**: ESP32 only works with 2.4GHz (not 5GHz)
3. **Signal strength**: Move ESP32 closer to router
4. **Router settings**: Ensure router allows new device connections (not MAC filtered)
5. **Reset WiFi**: Power cycle both ESP32 and router

### Motion Sensor Not Triggering

**Symptoms**:
- No motion detection in Serial Monitor
- No images being captured

**Solutions**:
1. **Check wiring**: Verify PIR sensor VCC, GND, and OUT connections
2. **Test sensor**: PIR has LED that lights when motion detected - check this
3. **Adjust sensitivity**: PIR sensor has two potentiometers on back:
   - Left pot: Sensitivity (distance)
   - Right pot: Time delay
   - Turn clockwise to increase
4. **Wait for warmup**: PIR sensors need 30-60 seconds to stabilize after power-on
5. **Check GPIO pin**: Ensure `PIR_SENSOR_PIN` in `config.h` matches your wiring

### SD Card Not Detected

**Symptoms**:
```
[ERROR] SD card mount failed
[ERROR] SD card not found
```

**Solutions**:
1. **Reformat SD card**: Use FAT32 format (not exFAT)
2. **Check SD card**: Try a different SD card (use Class 10, 32GB max)
3. **Reseat SD card**: Remove and reinsert firmly until it clicks
4. **Clean contacts**: Gently clean SD card contacts with isopropyl alcohol
5. **Check compatibility**: Some very old or very new cards may have issues

### Upload Failed / Port Not Found

**Symptoms**:
- "Port not found" error
- Upload timeout
- "Cannot communicate with board"

**Solutions**:
1. **Install FTDI drivers**: Download from https://ftdichip.com/drivers/vcp-drivers/
2. **Check USB cable**: Try a different cable (some are charge-only)
3. **Verify jumper**: Ensure GPIO 0 is connected to GND during upload
4. **Check port selection**: In VS Code, select correct COM port from bottom bar
5. **Try different USB port**: Some USB 3.0 ports have issues - try USB 2.0
6. **Reset ESP32**: Press reset button and try upload again

### Web Interface Not Loading

**Symptoms**:
- Browser shows "Cannot connect"
- Page timeout

**Solutions**:
1. **Verify IP address**: Double-check IP from Serial Monitor
2. **Ping ESP32**: From computer, open terminal/cmd and type:
   ```
   ping 192.168.1.123
   ```
   (Should get replies if connected)
3. **Check same network**: Computer and ESP32 must be on same WiFi network
4. **Firewall**: Disable firewall temporarily to test
5. **Try different browser**: Some browsers cache aggressively

### Images Are Black/Dark

**Symptoms**:
- Images save but are completely black
- Very dark images even in daylight

**Solutions**:
1. **Remove lens cap**: Check if camera lens has protective film/cap
2. **Check camera angle**: Ensure camera is pointing at subject, not blocked
3. **Lighting**: Test in well-lit area first
4. **Camera settings**: In `config.h`, try:
   ```cpp
   // Increase brightness
   sensor->set_brightness(sensor, 2);     // -2 to 2
   sensor->set_contrast(sensor, 2);       // -2 to 2
   ```

### Low Battery Warning

**Symptoms**:
```
[WARNING] Battery voltage low: 3.2V
[INFO] Entering power save mode
```

**Solutions**:
1. **Charge battery**: If using battery power, recharge or replace
2. **Use USB power**: For testing, use stable USB power supply
3. **Check power supply**: Ensure power supply provides adequate current (1A+)
4. **Adjust threshold**: In `config.h`, modify battery warning levels

### Serial Monitor Shows Gibberish

**Symptoms**:
- Random characters: `âœ¦Å¸Â¶â€šÂ¶`
- Unreadable output

**Solutions**:
1. **Set correct baud rate**: In PlatformIO Serial Monitor, select **115200** baud
2. **Reconnect**: Close and reopen Serial Monitor
3. **Check USB connection**: Ensure stable connection
