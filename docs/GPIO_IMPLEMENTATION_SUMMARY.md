- Pins: GPIO 18, 19, 23 conflicts
- Action: #error with detailed message
- Solution: Suggests ESP32-S3-CAM or disabling one feature

**Check 2: Solar Voltage Monitoring (GPIO 34)**
- Detects: Solar voltage monitoring on camera Y8 pin
- Pins: GPIO 34 conflict with camera
- Action: #error with alternatives
- Solution: External I2C ADC or ESP32-S3-CAM

**Check 3: Battery Voltage Monitoring (GPIO 34)**
- Detects: Battery monitoring on camera Y8 pin
- Pins: GPIO 34 conflict with camera
- Action: #error with alternatives
- Solution: External I2C ADC or ESP32-S3-CAM

**Check 4: SD Card + LED Conflicts**
- Detects: LED pins conflicting with SD card
- Pins: GPIO 2 (error), GPIO 4 (warning), GPIO 14 (warning)
- Action: #error for GPIO 2, #warning for others
- Solution: Reassign LEDs to GPIO 33

**Check 5: Servo + LoRa (AI-Thinker)**
- Detects: Servos and LoRa on AI-Thinker
- Pins: GPIO 16, 17 needed by both
- Action: #error
- Solution: ESP32-S3-CAM or disable one feature

**Check 6: IR LED + LoRa**

- Solution: Disable one or upgrade board

**Check 7: Audio + Camera (AI-Thinker)**
- Detects: I2S audio with camera
- Pins: GPIO 22, 25, 26 conflicts
- Action: #error
- Solution: ESP32-S3-CAM for both features

**Check 8: Multiple Feature Warning**
- Detects: More than 2 major features on AI-Thinker
- Action: #warning recommending ESP32-S3-CAM
- Solution: Review feature set or upgrade

**Check 9: Essential Features Validation**
- Detects: All connectivity disabled
- Action: #warning about limited functionality
- Solution: Enable at least one network feature

### 3. Testing

#### tests/test_gpio_conflicts.sh
**Purpose**: Automated testing of compile-time conflict detection

1. Camera + LoRa on AI-Thinker (should fail) ✅
2. Camera only on AI-Thinker (should pass) ✅
3. Camera + WiFi on AI-Thinker (should pass) ✅
4. Solar voltage on GPIO 34 with camera (should fail) ✅
5. Battery voltage on GPIO 34 with camera (should fail) ✅
6. SD card + LED on GPIO 2 (should fail) ✅
7. IR LED + LoRa on GPIO 16 (should fail) ✅
8. Audio + Camera on AI-Thinker (should fail) ✅
9. Servo + LoRa on AI-Thinker (should fail) ✅
10. Camera + LoRa on ESP32-S3 (should pass) ✅
