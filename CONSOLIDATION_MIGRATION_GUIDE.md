## üöÄ Quick Migration Steps

### For Simple DIY Users

#### Step 1: Update Your Repository Reference
```bash
# Old repository (archived)
git clone https://github.com/thewriterben/ESP32WildlifeCAM.git

# NEW consolidated repository
git clone https://github.com/thewriterben/WildCAM_ESP32.git
cd WildCAM_ESP32/ESP32WildlifeCAM-main/
```

#### Step 2: Navigate to Simple Setup Documentation
```bash
cd ESP32WildlifeCAM-main/
# Read the Quick Start Guide
cat QUICK_START.md
```

#### Step 3: Use Existing Configurations
All your existing ESP32WildlifeCAM configurations work without changes:
- Hardware setups remain the same
- Pin configurations unchanged
- Basic firmware in `ESP32WildlifeCAM-main/src/`
- Examples in `ESP32WildlifeCAM-main/examples/`

#### Step 4: Build and Deploy
```bash
cd ESP32WildlifeCAM-main/
pio run -e esp32cam -t upload
```

**‚úÖ That's it! You're migrated.**

cd firmware/
pio run -e esp32cam_advanced -t upload
```

**B. Cloud Platform Deployment**
```bash
# Backend API
cd backend/
pip install -r requirements.txt
python api/wildlife_api.py

# Frontend Dashboard
cd frontend/dashboard/
npm install && npm start
```

**C. Global Conservation Network**
```bash
# Review global network documentation
cat ESP32WildlifeCAM-main/docs/GLOBAL_CONSERVATION_NETWORK.md
