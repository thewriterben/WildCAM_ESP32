# STL File Management and Fallback System

## Status
The 3D model STL files in this repository contain placeholder content and need proper 3D models.

## Current State
All STL files contain basic placeholder geometry with comments indicating:
- File purpose and intended use
- Required mounting specifications  
- Compatibility notes
- Placeholder geometry (simple rectangular faces)

## Fallback Strategy
1. **Immediate**: STL files serve as documentation templates
2. **Development**: Use placeholder geometry for initial prototyping
3. **Production**: Replace with actual 3D models when available

## File Structure
```
3d_models/
├── common/              # Universal mounting hardware
├── ai_thinker_esp32_cam/  # AI-Thinker specific enclosures
├── esp32_s3_cam/        # ESP32-S3-CAM specific enclosures
├── thermal/             # Thermal camera accessories
└── budget_enclosures/   # Low-cost enclosure options
```

## Implementation Notes
- Files are valid STL format with minimal geometry
- Contains documentation in comments
- Serves as specification for future 3D modeling
- Graceful degradation when 3D printing unavailable

## Validation
- STL files pass basic format validation
- Contain required metadata in comments
- Placeholder geometry allows basic prototyping
- No "corrupted" files that would break 3D software

This approach provides immediate usability while allowing future enhancement without breaking the build system.
