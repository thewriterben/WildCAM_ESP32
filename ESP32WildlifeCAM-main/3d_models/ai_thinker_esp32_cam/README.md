   - Good chemical resistance

2. **ASA** (Premium choice)
   - Excellent UV resistance
   - High temperature resistance
   - Professional appearance
   - Requires enclosed printer

3. **ABS** (Alternative)
   - Good temperature resistance
   - Strong layer adhesion
   - Post-processing friendly
   - Acetone smoothing possible

### Print Settings
```
Layer Height: 0.2mm
Infill: 25% (walls), 100% (mounting points)
Wall Thickness: 1.2mm (3 perimeters)
Top/Bottom Layers: 5 layers
Support: Required for overhangs >45째
Print Speed: 40-60mm/s
```

## Assembly Instructions

### Step 1: Print Components
1. Print main enclosure in weather-resistant material
2. Print covers with appropriate material (clear PETG for front)
3. Print mounting hardware with 100% infill for strength

### Step 2: Hardware Installation
1. Install threaded inserts (M3 x 5mm recommended)
2. Install rubber gasket in lid groove
3. Test fit all components before final assembly

### Step 3: Electronics Assembly
1. Mount ESP32-CAM board using provided mounting posts
2. Route antenna through designated channel
3. Install solar charging circuit if used
4. Connect external sensors through cable glands

### Step 4: Weatherproofing
1. Apply silicone sealant to all cable entry points
2. Install breathable membrane in ventilation ports  
3. Test seal integrity before deployment

> **Detailed weatherproofing guidance:** See `../common/README.md` for comprehensive gasket installation, sealant application, and testing procedures.

## Customization Options

### Size Variants
- **Compact**: Minimal size for basic deployment
- **Extended**: Additional space for sensors and batteries
- **Professional**: Larger enclosure for research applications

### Mounting Options
- Tree strap mounting (included)
- Wall mount bracket (separate file)
- Tripod mounting (standard 1/4" thread)
- Ground stake mount (separate file)

### Environmental Adaptations
- **Desert**: Light colors, enhanced ventilation
- **Tropical**: Extended drainage, anti-fungal treatment
- **Arctic**: Insulated version, heating elements
- **Urban**: Stealth colors, vibration dampening

## Quality Control

### Pre-Deployment Testing
1. **Dimensional Check**: Verify all tolerances
2. **Weather Seal Test**: 24-hour water immersion
3. **Temperature Cycling**: -20째C to 60째C test
4. **UV Exposure**: 100-hour UV chamber test
5. **Drop Test**: 1.5m drop on concrete

### Field Validation
- Monitor for condensation in first 48 hours
- Check seal integrity after 30 days
- Inspect mounting hardware quarterly
- Replace gaskets annually

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Condensation**: Improve ventilation, add desiccant
2. **Loose fit**: Check print tolerances, adjust slicer settings
3. **Water ingress**: Inspect gaskets, reseal cable entries
4. **Mounting failure**: Use stainless steel hardware, apply thread locker

### Print Quality Issues
1. **Warping**: Use heated bed, enclosure, better bed adhesion
2. **Poor overhangs**: Increase support density, optimize angles
3. **Layer adhesion**: Increase temperature, reduce cooling
4. **Stringing**: Optimize retraction settings
