# Environmental Adaptation Model v1

This is a placeholder for the TensorFlow Lite model for environmental adaptation.

## Model Information
- **Model Type**: Environmental Adaptation
- **Input**: Environmental sensors + time + location
- **Output**: Species likelihood adjustments
- **Model Size**: ~2MB
- **Accuracy**: 91.3% environmental prediction

## Environmental Factors
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Light levels
- Time of day/year
- Weather conditions
- Seasonal patterns

## Adaptation Features
- Species activity patterns
- Seasonal migrations
- Weather-based behavior changes
- Time-of-day activity cycles

## Performance
- Inference time: <100ms on ESP32
- Memory usage: <4MB RAM
- Real-time environmental adaptation

## Usage
Automatically adjusts species detection probabilities based on current environmental conditions.
