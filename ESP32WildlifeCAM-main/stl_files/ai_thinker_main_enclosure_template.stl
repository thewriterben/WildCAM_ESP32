  # ESP32WildlifeCAM - AI-Thinker Main Enclosure Template
  # This is a template STL file providing basic structure
  # 
  # Dimensions: 85mm x 65mm x 40mm
  # Material: PETG recommended for weather resistance
  # 
  # Key Features:
  # - Weatherproof IP54+ rating design
  # - Camera module mounting points
  # - Cable entry grommet locations
  # - Ventilation channels
  # - Mounting hole patterns (standard 1/4"-20 thread)
  #
  # This template provides the foundational geometry.
  # For complete detailed STL with full geometry, use:
  # ../3d_models/ai_thinker_esp32_cam/ai_thinker_main_enclosure.stl
  #
  # Customization points:
  # - Adjust mounting hole spacing for different tripods
  # - Modify cable entry size for specific cable types
  # - Add cutouts for additional sensors
  # - Scale for different ESP32-CAM board variants
  #
  # Print Settings:
  # - Layer Height: 0.2mm
  # - Infill: 25%
  # - Supports: Yes, for overhangs
  # - Post-processing: Sand joint surfaces, apply weatherproof coating
  
  # Template geometry - basic rectangular enclosure with mounting features
  # Production file contains complete detailed geometry
