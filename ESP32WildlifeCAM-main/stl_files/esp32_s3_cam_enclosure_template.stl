  # ESP32WildlifeCAM - ESP32-S3-CAM Enclosure Template
  # This is a template STL file for ESP32-S3-CAM boards
  # 
  # Dimensions: 90mm x 70mm x 45mm (larger for S3 capabilities)
  # Material: PETG or ABS recommended
  # 
  # Key Features:
  # - Enhanced ventilation for higher-performance S3 chip
  # - USB-C access port for programming/debugging
  # - Larger camera sensor cutout (supports OV5640)
  # - AI acceleration heat dissipation design
  # - Multiple antenna mounting options
  #
  # This template provides the foundational geometry.
  # For complete detailed STL with full geometry, use:
  # ../3d_models/esp32_s3_cam/esp32_s3_main_enclosure.stl
  #
  # S3-Specific Customizations:
  # - Heat sink mounting points for AI processing
  # - Dual antenna support (WiFi + optional LoRa)
  # - Enhanced cable management for additional sensors
  # - Larger battery compartment for extended operation
