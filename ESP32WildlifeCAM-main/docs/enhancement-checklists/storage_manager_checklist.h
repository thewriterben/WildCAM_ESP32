 *     - [ ] SDMMC 4-bit mode for speed
 *     - [ ] FAT32 filesystem support
 *     - [ ] Wear leveling implementation
 *     - [ ] Bad sector detection
 * 
 * [ ] File Management
 *     - [ ] Circular buffer for old file deletion
 *     - [ ] Configurable retention period
 *     - [ ] File naming convention (timestamp-based)
 *     - [ ] Metadata JSON files for each capture
 * 
 * [ ] Storage Monitoring
 *     - [ ] Free space calculation
 *     - [ ] Write speed benchmarking
 *     - [ ] Corruption detection
 *     - [ ] Recovery procedures
 * 
 * CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:
 * 
 * âœ… Already Implemented in src/data/storage_manager.cpp:
 * - Complete StorageManager class with statistics tracking
 * - Automatic cleanup with configurable age limits
 * - Storage optimization and space management
 * - File organization by species and date
 * - JSON metadata generation for each capture
 * - Warning threshold monitoring
 * - Recursive file operations
 * 
 * ðŸ”„ Enhancement Opportunities:
 * - SDMMC 4-bit mode optimization
 * - Enhanced wear leveling algorithms
 * - Bad sector detection and recovery
 * - More sophisticated storage analytics
 * - Cloud storage integration hooks
 * 
 * Integration Points:
 * - Main Class: src/data/storage_manager.cpp
 * - Configuration: firmware/src/config.h (storage settings)
 * - Usage: firmware/src/main.cpp (SystemManager integration)
 * - Cleanup: Automatic when storage exceeds thresholds
