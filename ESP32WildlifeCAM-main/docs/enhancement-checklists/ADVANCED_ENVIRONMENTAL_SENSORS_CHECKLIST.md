    uint8_t activity = 50; // Base activity
    
    // Temperature factor (optimal 10-25°C)
    if (data.temperature >= 10.0 && data.temperature <= 25.0) {
        activity += 20;
    }
    
    // Light factor (dawn/dusk are optimal)
    if (data.visible_light > 10.0 && data.visible_light < 100.0) {
        activity += 15; // Dawn/dusk conditions
    }
    
    // Weather stability factor
    if (data.pressure > 1010.0 && data.pressure < 1020.0) {
        activity += 10; // Stable weather
    }
    
    return constrain(activity, 0, 100);
}
```

```cpp
bool environmentallyAwareCameraCapture() {
    AdvancedEnvironmentalData env_data = getLatestEnvironmentalData();
    
    if (env_data.photography_conditions > 70) {
        // Optimal conditions - configure for highest quality
        return CameraHandler::captureImage();
    } else if (env_data.photography_conditions > 40) {
        // Acceptable conditions - standard capture with metadata
        return CameraHandler::captureImage();
    } else {
        // Poor conditions - postpone capture
        return false;
    }
}
```

    // Filter motion in extreme weather conditions
    if (data.temperature > 35.0 || data.temperature < -5.0) {
        return true; // High thermal noise expected
    }
    
    // Filter during very high humidity (potential for false positives)
    if (data.humidity > 98.0) {
        return true; // Potential condensation artifacts
    }
    
    // Filter during very low air quality (dust/particles)
