# Budget Edition Wildlife Camera Assembly Guide

## Overview
Simplified assembly process for the budget-friendly wildlife camera using cost-effective components and streamlined design.

## Required Components

### 3D Printed Parts
- `basic_wildlife_cam_case.stl` - Single-piece design
- `solar_panel_mount.stl` - Basic solar mounting
- `battery_compartment.stl` - Simple battery housing
- `camera_lens_hood.stl` - Basic lens protection

### Electronic Components
- ESP32-CAM board (AI-Thinker or compatible)
- Basic PIR motion sensor
- 18650 battery with holder
- Small solar panel (5V, 0.5W minimum)
- Micro SD card (16GB sufficient)

### Hardware
- M3 x 6mm screws (4 pieces)
- Basic weatherproofing tape
- Cable ties
- Simple mounting bracket or zip ties

## Quick Assembly Steps

### Step 1: Electronics Preparation
1. Insert ESP32-CAM into main case
2. Connect PIR sensor using dupont wires
3. Install battery holder in compartment
4. Insert SD card

### Step 2: Basic Weatherproofing
1. Apply weatherproofing tape to seams
2. Use cable ties for strain relief
3. Ensure camera lens is protected

### Step 3: Solar Panel Setup
1. Attach solar panel to mount
2. Connect to ESP32-CAM power input
3. Secure with adhesive or screws

### Step 4: Deployment
1. Mount using zip ties or clamps
2. Orient camera and solar panel properly
3. Test basic functionality

## Budget Optimization Tips
- Use recycled or low-cost 3D printing filament
- Source components from bulk suppliers
- Simplify weatherproofing with readily available materials
- Use standard hardware store mounting solutions

## Performance Expectations
- Battery life: 2-4 weeks (without solar)
- Image quality: 1600x1200 (2MP)
- Detection range: 3-5 meters
- Operating temperature: 0°C to 40°C

## Cost-Saving Measures
- Print multiple units in batches
- Buy components in bulk
- Use generic sensors where possible
- Minimize specialized hardware

## Limitations
- Reduced weatherproofing compared to professional edition
- Shorter battery life
- Limited expansion options
- Basic motion detection
