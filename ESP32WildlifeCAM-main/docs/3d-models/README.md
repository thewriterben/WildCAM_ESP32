## STL File Reference

### Complete Implementation
Production-ready STL files are located in:
- `/3d_models/` - 20+ complete, tested STL files
- `/stl_files/` - Template files for customization

### Missing Files (See STL_TODO_LIST.md)
Critical files requiring community contribution:
- `ai_thinker_main_enclosure.stl`
- `solar_panel_mount_bracket.stl`
- `battery_compartment.stl`
- And 7 additional priority components

## Design Philosophy

### Professional vs. Budget Approaches
- **Professional**: IP65+ rating, multi-year durability, advanced features
- **Budget**: Basic protection, simplified assembly, cost optimization
- **Modular**: Mix-and-match components for specific deployment needs

### Environmental Considerations
- **Material Selection**: UV-resistant, weatherproof polymers
- **Thermal Management**: Ventilation without compromising sealing
- **Mechanical Stress**: Wind load, mounting stress, thermal cycling
- **Wildlife Safety**: Non-toxic materials, no sharp edges

## Quality Standards

### Dimensional Accuracy
- **Critical Dimensions**: ±0.1mm tolerance
- **Mounting Interfaces**: ±0.05mm for threaded inserts
- **Weatherproof Seals**: ±0.05mm for gasket surfaces
- **Cable Management**: ±0.2mm for cable gland interfaces

### Material Requirements
- **Primary**: PETG or ABS for structural components
- **Weather Resistance**: UV-stabilized filaments required
- **Temperature Range**: -20°C to +60°C operational
- **Chemical Resistance**: Mild acids, oils, wildlife deterrents

### Print Quality Standards
- **Layer Height**: 0.2mm maximum for structural components
- **Infill**: 20-30% minimum for load-bearing parts
- **Surface Finish**: <0.3mm roughness for sealing surfaces
- **Support Material**: PVA or HIPS for complex geometries

## Customization Guidelines

### Parametric Design
All designs should be parametric to enable:
- Different camera module sizes
- Various mounting configurations
- Regional climate adaptations
- Species-specific optimizations

### Modification Points
- **Camera Cutouts**: Adjustable for different lens sizes
- **Mounting Systems**: Configurable for various installation methods
- **Ventilation**: Scalable based on internal heat generation
- **Cable Management**: Adaptable for different cable configurations

## Testing and Validation

### Pre-Deployment Testing
1. **Dimensional Verification**: Check all critical dimensions
2. **Assembly Testing**: Complete assembly/disassembly cycles
3. **Weatherproof Testing**: IP rating validation procedures
4. **Stress Testing**: Mechanical load and thermal cycling

### Field Validation
1. **Environmental Exposure**: 3+ month outdoor testing
2. **Wildlife Interaction**: Non-interference validation
3. **Maintenance Access**: Serviceability in field conditions
4. **Long-term Durability**: Multi-year deployment tracking

## Community Contributions

### Contribution Process
1. **Design Review**: Submit designs via GitHub pull request
2. **Specification Check**: Verify compliance with quality standards
3. **Test Print**: Community validation of print quality
4. **Field Testing**: Real-world deployment verification
5. **Documentation**: Complete assembly and usage instructions

### Recognition System
