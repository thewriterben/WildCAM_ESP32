```

### Expected Output
```

```

---

## Step 5: Test Motion Detection (1 minute)

1. Wave hand in front of PIR sensor
2. Watch serial output:
```
Motion detected: PIR + Frame Analysis
Processing motion event...
Image captured: /images/20250101_120530.jpg (245678 bytes, 1234ms)
Species detected: Unknown (confidence: 0.42)
```

3. Check SD card - image file should be present in `/images/` folder

---

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Initialization Failed
- **Check**: SD card inserted and formatted (FAT32)
- **Check**: Camera ribbon cable properly connected
- **Fix**: Press RESET button, check serial output

### PIR Sensor Not Responding
- **Check**: PIR wired to GPIO 1 (not GPIO 13!)
- **Check**: PIR has power (red LED on sensor)
- **Check**: PIR sensitivity potentiometer adjusted
- **Wait**: PIR needs 30-60 seconds warm-up time

### SD Card Not Detected
- **Check**: SD card formatted as FAT32
- **Check**: SD card size 32GB or less
- **Try**: Different SD card
- **Check**: Metal shield on ESP32-CAM touching SD card

### No Serial Output
- **Check**: FTDI TX/RX not swapped
- **Check**: Baud rate is 115200
- **Check**: ESP32-CAM has power (LED on)
- **Check**: GPIO 0 NOT connected to GND (only for upload)

### Upload Failed
- **Check**: GPIO 0 connected to GND during upload
- **Check**: Press RESET while GPIO 0 is grounded
- **Check**: FTDI is 3.3V NOT 5V (5V damages ESP32)
- **Try**: Lower upload speed (230400 instead of 460800)

## Configuration Options

Edit `include/config.h` to customize:

### Camera Settings
```cpp
#define CAMERA_FRAME_SIZE FRAMESIZE_UXGA  // UXGA=1600x1200, SVGA=800x600
#define CAMERA_JPEG_QUALITY 12            // 10-63 (lower=better quality)
```

### Motion Detection
```cpp
#define MOTION_THRESHOLD 10               // Sensitivity (lower=more sensitive)
#define PIR_DEBOUNCE_TIME 2000           // ms between triggers
```

### Power Management
```cpp
#define POWER_SAVE_MODE_ENABLED true      // Enable power saving
#define MAX_DAILY_TRIGGERS 100            // Max photos per day
```

### Storage
```cpp
#define IMAGE_FOLDER "/images"
#define MAX_DAILY_TRIGGERS 100
```
