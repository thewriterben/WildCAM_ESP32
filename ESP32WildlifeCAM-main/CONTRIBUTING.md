   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ESP32WildlifeCAM.git
   cd ESP32WildlifeCAM
   ```

2. **Set Up Development Environment**
   ```bash
   # Install PlatformIO
   pip install platformio
   
   # Set up offline development (if needed)
   chmod +x scripts/setup_offline_environment.sh
   ./scripts/setup_offline_environment.sh --cache-only
   ```

3. **Validate Environment**
   ```bash
   # Run validation checks
   python3 validate_fixes.py
   ./scripts/quick_validate.sh
   ```

4. **Create Development Branch**
   ```bash
   # Create feature branch
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### First Contribution Ideas
- **Documentation Improvements** - Fix typos, clarify instructions, add examples
- **Code Comments** - Add explanatory comments to existing code
- **Testing** - Run validation scripts and report any issues
- **Hardware Testing** - Test with different ESP32 boards and report compatibility
- **Bug Reports** - Document any issues you encounter with detailed reproduction steps

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style Standards
- **Language**: C++ for firmware, Python for scripts, Markdown for documentation
- **Formatting**: Use consistent indentation (4 spaces, no tabs)
- **Comments**: Clear, descriptive comments for complex algorithms
- **Naming**: Descriptive variable and function names
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error checking and recovery

### Architecture Principles
- **Modular Design** - Clean separation of concerns
- **Hardware Abstraction** - Support for multiple board variants
- **Offline Operation** - Function without internet connectivity
- **Power Efficiency** - Optimize for battery-powered operation
- **Documentation-Driven** - Every feature should have clear documentation

### Coding Standards Example
```cpp
// Good: Descriptive naming and clear error handling
bool CameraManager::captureImage(const String& filename) {
    if (!isInitialized()) {
        logger.error("Camera not initialized");
        return false;
    }
    
    camera_fb_t* frameBuffer = esp_camera_fb_get();
    if (frameBuffer == nullptr) {
        logger.error("Failed to capture image from camera");
        return false;
    }
    
    bool success = storageManager.saveImage(frameBuffer, filename);
    esp_camera_fb_return(frameBuffer);
    
    return success;
}
```
