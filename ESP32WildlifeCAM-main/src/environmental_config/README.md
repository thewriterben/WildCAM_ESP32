## System Architecture

### Environmental Variant Manager
The system uses a centralized `EnvironmentalVariantManager` class that:
- Automatically detects optimal variant based on environmental conditions
- Manages variant-specific configurations and hardware
- Provides unified API for all environmental adaptations
- Handles emergency responses for environmental extremes

### Variant Selection Process
1. **Manual Selection**: User specifies variant during configuration
2. **Auto-Detection**: System analyzes environmental conditions
3. **Geographic Auto-Config**: Automatic selection based on GPS coordinates
4. **Adaptive Mode**: Dynamic switching based on seasonal changes

### Integration with Existing System
Environmental variants extend the existing enclosure configuration system:
- Builds upon `firmware/src/enclosure_config.h`
- Maintains compatibility with existing hardware detection
- Extends material recommendations and assembly instructions
- Adds environmental-specific monitoring and protection

## Usage Examples

### Automatic Variant Selection
```cpp
#include "environmental_config/environmental_variant_manager.h"

// Initialize environmental variant system
initializeEnvironmentalVariants();

// Define deployment conditions
EnvironmentalConditions conditions;
conditions.temperature_min = 18.0;    // Â°C
conditions.temperature_max = 42.0;    // Â°C
conditions.humidity_avg = 90.0;       // %
conditions.precipitation_annual = 2500.0; // mm
conditions.climate_description = "Tropical rainforest";

// Auto-detect optimal variant
EnvironmentalVariant variant = g_environmentalVariantManager.autoDetectVariant(conditions);
g_environmentalVariantManager.setVariant(variant);
```

### Manual Variant Configuration
```cpp
// Set specific variant
g_environmentalVariantManager.setVariant(VARIANT_TROPICAL);

// Get deployment recommendations
String recommendations = g_environmentalVariantManager.getDeploymentRecommendations(
    VARIANT_TROPICAL, "Amazon Basin, Brazil"
);

// Generate maintenance schedule
String schedule = g_environmentalVariantManager.generateMaintenanceSchedule(
    VARIANT_TROPICAL, 180 // 6 months deployment
);
```

### Environmental Monitoring
```cpp
void loop() {
    // Update environmental management
    updateEnvironmentalVariants();
    
    // Check environmental health
    uint8_t health = g_environmentalVariantManager.getEnvironmentalHealth();
    if (health < 50) {
        Serial.println("Environmental conditions degraded - check system");
    }
    
    // Handle emergency conditions automatically
    // (Emergency handling is automatic within the variant managers)
}
