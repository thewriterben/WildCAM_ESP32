PIN CONFLICT CHECK VALIDATION SUMMARY
=====================================

✓ Implemented 5 compile-time pin conflict checks:
  1. LoRa + Camera conflict on AI-Thinker ESP32-CAM
  2. SD Card + LED pin conflicts  
  3. Servo + LoRa conflicts on AI-Thinker
  4. IR LED + LoRa chip select conflict
  5. Multiple feature combination check

✓ Available GPIO pins documented:
  - GPIO 1, 3 (UART - use with caution)
  - GPIO 12, 13, 15, 16 (available when SD disabled)
  - GPIO 2 (LED, available when SD disabled)

✓ Reserved pins clearly marked:
  - GPIO 0, 5, 18-27, 32, 34-36, 39: Camera
  - GPIO 2, 4, 12-15: SD card (when enabled)
  - GPIO 6-11: Flash (NEVER use)

✓ ESP32-S3-CAM recommended for:
  - Full feature set (Camera + LoRa + Servos + All Sensors)
  - More RAM and processing power
  - No pin conflicts

✓ Documentation created:
  - docs/HARDWARE_FEATURE_GUIDELINES.md (350+ lines)
  - Updated README.md files with hardware warnings
  - Test file: test/test_pin_conflict_checks.cpp

✓ Developer guidelines established:
  1. Always check config.h for pin conflicts
  2. Use only documented GPIO pins
  3. Add compile-time checks for new features
  4. Document all pin assignments
  5. Recommend ESP32-S3-CAM when needed

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA MET:
✓ All new hardware features are checked for pin conflicts
✓ Only documented GPIO pins are used on AI-Thinker ESP32-CAM
✓ Full feature warning documented for ESP32-S3-CAM
✓ All pin assignments clearly documented
✓ Compile-time #error checks prevent conflicting pin usage
✓ Example checks provided for developers
