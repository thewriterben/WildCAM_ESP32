## ESP32-S3-CAM Platform Features

### Enhanced Capabilities vs ESP32-CAM
- **Dual-core Xtensa LX7** - Better performance for AI processing
- **Vector instructions** - Hardware AI/ML acceleration
- **More GPIO pins** - Reduced pin conflicts for sensors
- **Built-in USB** - Native programming without external adapters
- **Larger PSRAM** - 8MB for better image processing
- **WiFi 6 support** - Improved connectivity and range

### Design Considerations
- **Larger board size** (45x30mm vs 40.5x27mm) - Different mounting points
- **Enhanced heat dissipation** - Better ventilation needed for AI processing
- **USB-C connector access** - Native programming port integration
- **External antenna options** - Improved wireless performance
- **Additional sensor support** - More GPIO availability

## Material Recommendations

### Primary Materials
- **PETG** - Excellent outdoor durability, UV resistance, chemical resistance
- **ASA** - Superior UV stability, higher temperature resistance
- **ABS** - Good impact resistance, suitable for mechanical components

### Environmental Considerations
- **Operating temperature**: -20°C to +60°C
- **Weather rating**: IP65 minimum with proper assembly
- **UV resistance**: Essential for long-term outdoor deployment
- **Chemical resistance**: Wildlife deterrents, cleaning agents

## Print Settings

### Quality Standards
- **Layer Height**: 0.2mm for structural components, 0.15mm for detailed parts
- **Infill**: 20-30% minimum for load-bearing parts, 15% for accessories
- **Wall Count**: 3-4 perimeters for weatherproofing
- **Support**: Required for overhangs >45°, use PVA or HIPS for complex geometries
